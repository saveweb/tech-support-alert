	Introduction</h1>
<p><img alt="eBook image" src="files/eBook&#32;image_1.jpg" style="margin: 8px 16px 8px 0px; float: left;" />This is a listing of 913 sites that legally offer free books (eBooks) for download or for online viewing. You can easily check out this listing in alphabetical order via the <a href="best-free-ebooks-online.htm#Index"><strong>Index</strong></a> on this page.</p>
<p>Some time ago I went looking for some free eBooks and was surprised to find that there are many resources for this. I decided to put together this list of sites that offer free eBooks. Originally, the list was for 50 sites and I thought that was a lot. Given the large listing, you may want to check out the various Genre pages that I have put together.  Each genre has an ebook and an audiobook page.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b><a href="https://www.techsupportalert.com/free-ebooks-and-audiobooks-to-read-online-or-download.htm" target="_blank">Free eBooks and Audio Books To Read Online Or Download </a></b></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in free<b><a href="free-books-comics" target="_blank"> Comic eBooks</a></b> or free <b><a href="free-books-textbooks" target="_blank">Textbooks &amp; Online Courses</a></b>, then you should check the genre pages for those. Many of those are not included here due to the fact they are not ebooks. </p>
<p>I have also put together a listing of sites that offer free and legal audiobooks:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p><b><a href="free-books-audio" target="_blank">Best Free Audio Books Online</a></b>  (224 sites)</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>I have tried to make certain that all of the eBooks at these sites are legally available for viewing/downloading.  However, it is possible that I have made a mistake.  If you suspect any of these sites of illegally offering copyrighted materials, then please let me know through the comments below.</p>
<p>Putting this together was exhausting, but the list is not exhaustive, so I encourage you to post any sites that you know of that are not listed here.</p>
<h2 class="header2">
	Libraries</h2>
<p>On the advice of anonymous poster that most public library systems offer free ebooks, audiobooks, and music downloads to their customers for free, I did some checking and found that there are a large amount of offerings available through online libraries.  It appears most, if not all, require a local library card.  These are sites that have links to local library sites.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b><a href="http://search.overdrive.com/" target="_blank">Overdrive</a> </b>is the site to use to access your library online for free ebooks.  It will help you find a branch near you that has this feature.  You must have a valid library card and PIN</li>
</ul>

It is not great that they are spread out over who knows how many sites. This article lists 224 sites and we can be certain that is not an exhaustive list.<br />
Who among us is going to visit (and browse) 224 sites looking for audio books of interest to them? I think no one - anybody that does has way too much time on their' hands.<br />
I suppose the obvious solution is for someone to create a "meta-site" that aggregates all these repositories into a single searchable database. That would be the 225th site I would like to see. If it exists already I would appreciate getting the link.<br />
Same goes for ebooks.</p>

Also it would not work (to show only free) for all of the sites listed here or on the audiobook page as some of the sites offer both free and paid selections.

I believe one could put together a search engine for the sites that have only free listings (so that all results are free) using Google's personalized search engines.  However, maintaining the 47 pages of free ebook and audiobook listings here is more than enough for me and I would not have the time to put together such an endeavor (and keep it updated).

If you, or someone else, wants to put together such a search engine, I would be very happy to feature it prominently in these listings.
